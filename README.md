# No Conjugues
A Conjuguemos hack designed to automatically do your homework.

Source code is obfuscated to make it more difficult for Conjuguemos to patch the hack. But you know what? Instead of trying to patch every method of cheating, just rebuild the education system from the ground up!


<h2>HOW TO RUN</h2>
* To run, log in to Conjuguemos.

* Open an assignment.

* Do Ctrl+Shift+J (or right-click and hit Inspect Element, and click Console at the top).

* Copy all the code in the <a href="https://github.com/theplummer/NoConjugues/blob/main/NoConjugues.js">NoConjugues.js</a> file.

* Then paste the code you copied in the console, then press enter. Voila! The hack has been activated!

Alternatively, you can install this as a script in Tampermonkey.

**NOTE: This script is in development and currently supports only one kind of assignment (where you input answers for a specified amount of time). However, that should be alleviated in the future.**
